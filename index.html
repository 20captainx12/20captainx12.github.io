		<h1>Visiting</h1>
		<p>We are unsure about events in Fish at this time. Fish is still in the development phase, but we hope to hope events within the next few months.</p>
		<p>If you are interested, feel free to contact me from any of the social media provided <a href="http://20captainx12.uk">on my site.</a>
		<p>I hope that I will establish an event plaza, which is in direct route from the airport. I hope to make it very pretty and presentable, but this might take months to be finished.</p>
		<p>Your patience is appreciated :)</p>
		<p>Fish has yet to be opened to the public.</p>
		<p>Fish's official language is English(UK)</p>
		<p>There are no documented cases of COVID-19 in Fish. (This joke aged badly)</p>
		<p>Fish does not offer medical insurance.</p>
		<p>Fish is currently an unrecognised nation state which doesn't have any diplomatic relations with other islands.</p>
		<p>Fish won't eat you.</p>

		<p id="07042020">07/04/2020:Woah, I have been neglectful! Okay, so I have been playing ACNH non-stop, but now this site has it's own domain! It is hosted by Github Pages now instead of Neocities, and setting up the domain took some effort. But all is good now! <br> Fish is currently undergoing the bunny day event as well as having trees blossom. We also have a town of 11 residents (including me) and four stars.
