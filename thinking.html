		29/02/2020 My apologies for the absence. I had nothing really to post. I made a second site! It is accessible <a href=https://fishacnh.neocities.org/>here</a>. It is for my future animal crossing island :)

		<p>09/01/2020 I decided to replace my theme on the main page! It is the same song, just a different instrumental version. Here is the old one:<br><audio src="https://media.vocaroo.com/mp3/lxwRif2ILoF" loop="true" controls></audio>

		<p>03/01/2020 HAPPY NEW DECADE! I removed the Christmas theme, and also at one point added the flag of IV drip. <br> <h2>So what is the flag of IV Drip?</h2><p>It is the flag of my friend group. The green bottom-left corner is me, the purple canton is Star, and the orange field is Jess and Sjoerd!</p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/609207203332882432/660862696077525022/unknown.png" width="50%"><br>The specifications are: <i>"The flag of IV Drip has a purple canton and a green lower hoist that both end in the center of the flag. The field of the flag is Orange. It should be displayed in a 2:1 ratio."</i>

		<p>09/12/2019 I finished adding description boxes to the images. Click them to try it out!

		<p>08/12/2019: I have been developing a description box for my photos, so that would be fun! It uses a separate stylesheet so that's cool.</p>

		06/12/2019: I am finally beginning to feel festive. I also added more slots into the gallery. I don't know when I will utilise the gallery though to add descriptions, etc.

		<p>02/12/2019: Yesterday I got a Google Home Hub as part of a black friday sale. It has since replaced the picture frame on my desk of Oreo and Sandstone. It shows the same picture as well, which is neat. It completely blends in and doesn't look at all like a screen, until it is used. I can sit and watch the news while working on my computer at the same time, it's really nice.</p>
		<p>Anyway, there are rumours going around online of Queen Elizabeth II's passing? I heavily doubt the rumours as the source is just an easily faked Whatsapp group, but it claims we will find out today at 9:30am.... which isn't the protocol. The protocol is 8am, and morbidly coincidentially the code word is "London Bridge is down"</p>

		<p>30/11/2019 St Andrew's day: I allowed support for a decoration image to be added whether it be buntings or baubles. It is discreet enough but a nice touch and can be updated without updating html pages. It will be up on December 1st at 00:00GMT. Realistically, nobody would have ever read this before that time, but it will be here for historical documentation, I guess.</p><p>Also this isn't going to entirely be a devplace, and more of a thoughts place which of course would include development updates.</p>

		<div id="29112019">
		<p>29/11/2019: I updated the programming slightly so you can link directly to certain posts here. It is done by putting a # and then the date in DDMMYYYY format without slashes. An example is this one. The url 20captainx12.uk/thinking.html#29112019 should lead to this post. Try it out!</p>
		</p> <p> Anyway, the attacks on London Bridge today were horrendous, and shocking considering it brought back flashbacks what happened in the past. Sadly two people passed away from this incident, and such acts of terror are cowardly and the 'people' who carry them out are scum.</p>

		<p>27/11/2019: Finally, I added this as a new page and updated the general page overall. Hope it is appreciated :)</p>
		<p>Maybe I can fancy it up a bit more?</p>
		<p>That's for later, I guess.</p>

		<div id=""25112019">
		<p>25/11/2019: I may eventually make this a dedicated page, but I am lazy so not right now. There isn't much on here anyway so does it really matter?
		Anyhow, I like how my site is shaping up and stuff so that's always cool. Still a bit bland though, but I don't wish to go insane like every other neocities site :P<br>What if I made this site a cool homepage for myself? I would need to insert a Google search bar and that would be it, really.<br> Turns out emojis aren't supported, so I will put them in with img tags.

		<p>24/11/2019:My friend and I were talking about how crappy Instagram was, and then I remembered Neocities exists. Neocities seems to be the only good way for one to express themselves in the way the internet intended, so I bought a domain and decided to use it. <br>
		Forgive me for this beta site as I am still experimenting in this world of complete independence, but I may occasionally post photos here.
		<br> My dream for the internet is for everyone to be able to express themselves this way. We can possibly use technology such as RSS to follow eachother, and we can have a free internet at last.<br> Of course, I still have to use big corporations like imgur to host my images, but it is still nice to have my own space that I can control the layout. Hopefully big things are yet to come!
		<br>Anyway, enjoy these 6 images and thanks for stopping by. The link to my instagram is back up top if you need help finding your way back.</p>
